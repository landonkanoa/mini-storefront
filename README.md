This has been in every way the worst coding project or challenge so far oh my goodness gracious everything about my time doing this project sucked. Zero introduction for anything was actually so evil (no hate I love this class) but my goodness I thought this was gonna be maybe 3 hours long but I have been working on it for the last 8 hours. I am a crazy bad procrastinator and have been busy all week with halloween and stuff like that and because of how stressful this project was it has just made me so nervous for this project I really think I did a good job so I am excited to see what I get. I am using this readme section as like a little rant so I hope you read it and I hope you had a great halloween.
